What is Digital Marketing?
Digital marketing involves leveraging online platforms and technologies to promote products and services. It encompasses a wide array of techniques and channels, including email marketing, pay-per-click advertising (PPC), social media marketing, affiliate marketing, and content creation. The primary objective is to engage consumers, foster connections, and drive conversions by using digital tools that are an integral part of everyday life.

Why Digital Marketing Matters?
As consumers increasingly spend time online, businesses need to meet them where they are. The convenience of browsing the internet has transformed how people research products, compare prices, and make purchasing decisions. Digital marketing provides several advantages over traditional methods:-

Global Reach: Digital marketing enables businesses to connect with a worldwide audience, making market expansion more accessible than ever.
Cost-Effectiveness: Compared to traditional advertising methods like print and television, digital marketing offers a more affordable solution with a higher return on investment (ROI).  
Targeted Advertising: Tools like Google Ads and Facebook Ads allow for precise audience targeting based on demographics, interests, and behaviours, ensuring your message reaches the right people.
Data-Driven Insights: Digital marketing provides access to detailed analytics, enabling businesses to track performance, refine strategies, and achieve better results over time.
